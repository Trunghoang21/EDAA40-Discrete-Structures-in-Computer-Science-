    "    * The name of the lemma comes from the analogy that, during a cocktail party where it will always be an even number of guests that have shaken hands an odd number of times. Model this situation using a graph and argue that the hand-shaking lemma implies this fact. What do the nodes in the cocktail party graph represent? And the edges?\n",

    "### Programming Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming exercise, we will explore a famous theorem of Leonhard Euler that kickstarted the study of graph theory as we know it today. The problem is motivated by the well-known problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg. The story goes that back when Euler lived in Königsberg, the city had its neighborhoods divided in four areas, which were connected by bridges according to the picture below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"bridges1.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is said that the people of Königsberg would go for walks, starting and finishing at the same area, trying to see if they could cross each bridge exactly one and come back to the place they started at. Sadly, nobody seemed to succeed in this, despite the many variations that they tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler observation is that the map of Königsberg could be simplified into a *graph*: edges would be bridges between nodes that would represent the four areas of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1:** Draw a graph with four nodes and seven edges that captures the bridges of the map of Königsberg, like Euler did.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image1.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice something funny? Technically speaking, this graph has repeated edges! This is because to go from the middle neighborhood of the city to the top one, we can take two different bridges. This is technically not allowed in our usual definition of graphs. When we allow this other situation, we say that we have a *multigraph*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When encoding a multigraph, we can no longer encode the edge relation as a set $E \\subseteq V \\times V$, because by definition, sets remove multiple copies of the same set. Hence, it is more convenient to use something like a *list*. While the list $\\mathsf{[1, 2, 2, 3]}$ has two copies of 2, as a set this would become $\\mathsf{\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}}$. Luckily for us, in Python the most convenient data structure for collections of objects is precisely the *list*, so we are all good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2:** Suppose we call the four neighborhoods of Königsberg $1, 2, 3, 4$, where 1 corresponds to the central island, 2 and 3 are respectively the North and South parts, and 4 is the Eastern mass of land. Define in Python a list containing the ordered pairs of the edges that are present in the graph above. Below you can see an example. We will adopt the following convention: since the graph is undirected, when adding an edge from $i$ to $j$, we always add the pair $(i, j )$ for $i < j$ and *not* $(j, i)$, although we will assume that $(j, i)$ is also implicit; and if there are multiple copies of the same edge, we will add it multiple times."

Therefore, the graph must be connected. \n",

Euler's key insight that what mattered was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of *topology*: the difference between the actual layout and the graph schematic is a good example of the idea that topology is not concerned with the rigid shape of objects.\n",

That called in question the traditional Aristotelian view that mathematics is the \"science of quantity\".
