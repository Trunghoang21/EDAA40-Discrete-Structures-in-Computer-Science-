    "To find all primes less than or equal to a given integer $n$, the Sieve of Eratosthenes proceeds in the following steps.\n",
    "1. Create a list $L$ of consecutive integers up to $n$: $L = (2, 3, \\ldots, n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize $p=2$, the smallest prime number. \n",
    "\n",

    "4. Find the smallest number in $L$ greater than $p$ which is not marked. If no such number exists, terminate. Otherwise, let $p$ equal this new number and repeat from step $3$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task 1:** Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes as a python function `eratosthenes(n)` as described in Steps 1-5 and find the $10$ largest prime numbers that are smaller than $1\\;000\\;000$. Hint: for better performance, let the list consist of either True or False instead of the numbers themselves, and let the numbers be represented by the index of this Boolean in the list.\n"
