    "Solutions to the following exercises are to be handed in for peer grading, either typed or handwritten. Write neatly and concisely, so the solutions are easy to read.

    "1. Express each of the following predicates and propositions in formal predicate logic notation. The domain is the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$. You may define predicates involving logical symbols ($\\land$, $\\lor$, $\\neg$, $\\to$, $\\forall$, $\\exists$), but also the arithmetic symbols $+$, $\\cdot$, $=$ and any integer constants $0, 1, \\dots$. You may *not* use exponentiation symbols, $x^y$. For example, the predicate \"$n$ is an even number\" could be defined as $\\operatorname{Even}(n) := \\exists m. (2m = n)$ or as $\\operatorname{Even}'(n) := \\exists m. (m + m = n)$.\n",

    "   \n",
    "3. A predicate formula is in *prenex form* when all its quantifiers come at the beginning. For example, \n",
    "$$ \\forall x \\exists y \\forall z \\exists w (P(x, w) \\land (Q(x, y) \\lor R(z))) $$\n",

In order to do this, use De Morgan's laws to push negations into the formula: $\\neg \\forall x. P(x)$ becomes $\\exists x. \\neg P(x)$, and vice versa. When doing this, read the formulas out loud to make sure the transformation make sense to you.\n",
